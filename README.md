# tictactoe

## What is it?
This is a Java web application of the game '*Tic Tac Toe*'.
* It uses Maven to compile it into a `.war` file to be hosted on a local server.
* It is currently being built using JetBrains Intellij IDEA Ultimate 2019.1 <sup>* I will configure it to work with Eclipse when completed.</sup>

### Why develop it?
I've started to develop this to show my ability as a software developer to develop, test and build an application.

## Why a Maven web project?
The reason why I chose a *web application* for this is because it'll make it a lot more pleasing to look at, rather than having it in a console.

I also chose it because Maven comes with a lot of functionalities with testing and building applications.
